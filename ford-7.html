            <p style="font-size:large; color: aliceblue;">Ford India Private Limited began production in 1926 as a subsidiary of the Ford Motor Company of Canada. The initial Ford India company was liquidated in May 1953 as a result of severe import restrictions having been enacted.[6] Ford re-entered the Indian market in October 1995 as Mahindra Ford India Limited (MFIL), a 50-50 joint venture with Mahindra & Mahindra Limited. Ford increased its interest to 72% in March 1998 and renamed the company Ford India Private Limited.[7] The total investments made by Ford Motor Company since it set shop in 1995 stands at $2 billion as of April 2012.[8]

                Ford launched several models in India, including the sixth generation European Ford Escort and the Ford Ikon, later followed by the Ford Mondeo (second generation). In late 2004 Ford launched the European Ford Fusion,[9] which brought a totally new segment to India - the crossover which the company called as an Urban Activity Vehicle & marketed in India as The-No-Nonsense-Car; going by its name, it was a very practical car way ahead of its time, and was popular mostly among enthusiasts.
                
                Ford launched the Ford Fiesta in its sedan guise which was widely received in the market and was a sales success. Ford also launched the Ford Figo, based on the sixth generation Ford Fiesta hatchback in the Indian market.

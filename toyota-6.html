            <p style="font-size:large; color: aliceblue;">TKMPL's current plant at Bidadi, Karnataka is spread across 850 acres and has a capacity of 110,000 vehicles per annum.[5] TKMPL's second manufacturing plant on the outskirts of Bengaluru, Karnataka has a capacity of 210,000 vehicles per annum. Total production capacity is 320,000 vehicles per annum. On 16 March 2011, it announced that it was increasing production to 210,000 vehicles per annum[6] due to increase in demand for its models especially the Etios and Fortuner.

                With effect from 1 June 2012, Toyota Kirloskar Motor will be increasing the prices of Etios diesel and Innova by 1 per cent and Fortuner and Etios Liva diesel by 0.5 per cent. The price hike is on account of the weakening of Rupee.[7] Toyota announced that Etios sedan and the Liva hatchback has posted sales of over 100,000 units, hence Toyota is all set for giving its production a big boost. Toyota Kirloskar Motor (TKM) plans to hike the production capacity of its Etios series models by 75% by early 2013.[8] Toyota Kirloskar Motors would launch its motor racing series in 3 cities in India next year.[9

    <p p style="font-size:large; color: aliceblue;">Hyundai Motor India Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Hyundai Motor Company headquartered in South Korea. It is the second largest automobile manufacturer with 16.2% market share as of February 2019 and US$5.5 billion turn-over in India.

        Hyundai Motor India Limited was formed on 6 May 1996 by the Hyundai Motor Company of South Korea. When Hyundai Motor Company entered the Indian automobile market in 1996 the Hyundai brand was almost unknown throughout India.
        During the entry of Hyundai in 1996, there were only five major automobile manufacturers in India, i.e. Maruti, Hindustan, Premier, Tata and Mahindra. Daewoo had entered the Indian automobile market with Cielo just three years back while Ford, Opel and Honda had entered less than a year back.
        For more than a decade till Hyundai arrived, Maruti Suzuki had a near monopoly over the passenger cars segment because Tata Motors and Mahindra & Mahindra were solely utility and commercial vehicle manufacturers, while Hindustan and Premier both built outdated and uncompetitive products.

     HMIL's first car, the Hyundai Santro was launched on 23 September 1998 and was a runaway success. Within a few months of its inception HMIL became the second largest automobile manufacturer and the largest automobile exporter in India.

As HMC's global export hub for compact cars, HMIL is the first automotive company in India to achieve the export of 10 lakh cars in just over a decade. HMIL currently exports cars to more than 87 countries. It has been the number one exporter of passenger cars of the country for the eighth year in a row.[2]
To support its growth and expansion plans, HMIL currently has 1200 strong dealer network and more than 1,309 strong service points across India.
